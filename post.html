<h2> The Science Between Stars</h2>

<p> The silence out here is like nothing I’ve ever known. It’s not the silence of an empty room or the hushed quiet of a midnight forest. This is something deeper—an overwhelming, all-encompassing quiet that presses against my mind like a weight. The hum of the ship’s engine is the only sound that breaks the silence, and even that fades when I pause to listen closely.

    Out here in the deep expanse, I’m surrounded by the remnants of stars—some dead, some still glowing faintly in the distance. The stars seem so small, so far away, but the silence makes them feel closer. I sometimes wonder if I’m the only human left in the universe.
    
    I’ve been traveling for years now, jumping from one system to another, exploring planets that no one has ever set foot on, cataloging strange new forms of life, and collecting data on phenomena that seem almost too incredible to believe. Yet, in all this wonder, there’s a loneliness that claws at me.
    
    There’s no one to share these discoveries with, no one to talk to when I need someone to ground me. It’s just me, my ship, and the vast, infinite cosmos. The people back home, on Earth or in the colonies, they’re distant echoes now—voices I hear only in transmissions, voices that seem to grow more distant with every passing year.
    
    The only thing that keeps me sane is the knowledge that I’m not just wandering aimlessly. I’m a part of something greater. Every discovery I make adds to the collective knowledge of humanity. Every new world, every alien lifeform, is a tiny piece of the cosmic puzzle. And even though I am alone in this vastness, I am never truly alone.
    
    As I drift through these silent voids, I find myself thinking of Earth, of the home I left behind. I wonder what life is like now, how much has changed in the years I’ve been gone. I wonder if I’ll ever return or if I’ll continue to drift forever in the unknown. For now, though, it’s just me and the stars.
    
    I’ll keep my course steady. There’s always something new waiting just beyond the horizon. </p>
